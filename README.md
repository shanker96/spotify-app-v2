# spotify-app-v2

# Backend Development (Node.js):
• Set up a Node.js server to handle API requests and responses.
• Utilized the Spotify API to authenticate and fetch user data, including top artists, top tracks, and top playlists.
• Implemented API endpoints to handle different types of requests for user data from the Spotify API.
 
# Frontend Development (React.js):
• Built a user-friendly and responsive user interface using React.js to display the fetched user data.
• Designed and implemented components for displaying top artists, top tracks, and top playlists.
• Implemented user authentication using Spotify's authentication flow to allow users to log in and authorize the application to access their Spotify data.
• Containerized the application using Docker to package the backend and frontend components into separate containers.
• Created Docker images for the Node.js server and the React.js frontend, along with their dependencies and configurations.
• Defined a Docker Compose file to orchestrate the deployment and management of the containers.
 
# Deployment (AWS EC2):
• Deployed the Docker containers to an AWS EC2 instance, which is a virtual server in the Amazon Web Services cloud.
• Configured the EC2 instance with the necessary dependencies and configurations for running the Docker containers.
• Set up security groups and firewalls to restrict access to the EC2 instance and ensure the security of the application.
• Monitored and managed the deployed containers using Docker commands and AWS EC2 management tools.
 
# Overall Project:
• Created a full stack application that extracts user data from the Spotify API and displays it on a profile page using Node.js and React.js.
• Containerized the application using Docker to simplify deployment and management.
• Deployed the Docker containers to an AWS EC2 instance for hosting and running the application in a cloud environment.
• Implemented user authentication and error handling to ensure a smooth user experience.
• Built a responsive and user-friendly user interface for displaying the user's top artists, top tracks, and top playlists from Spotify.
